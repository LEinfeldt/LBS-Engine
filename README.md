# LBS-Engine

This is a Cordova app, developed to allow users to create a location based service without detailed programming knowledge. The app can be adjusted using two configuration files, that can be changed to settings fitting the user's needs.

LBS-Engine was developed for the [ifgi](http://ifgi.de). Its main purpose is to have a basic template for running user studies in the field of geoinformatics.

## Installation

Install the app and run it on your machine or on a smartphone.

#### Required Software
Install this software to run this project:

- Apache Cordova
- node.js (npm)

To add functionality, or modify the state of the `config.json` or `layers.json`:

- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
- [Babelify](https://github.com/babel/babelify)

#### Installation
- Clone this repository
- Add the cordova platform you want to use `cordova platform add <platformname>` [Cordova Getting started](https://cordova.apache.org/#getstarted)
- Run `npm run build`
- Run `cordova run <platformname>`

## Modifications of the existing app

#### Modify the app's defaults
- Go the the file `src/data_components/config.json` (contains all available settings)
- Set the settings in the `app` component in a way you want your default settings (`true/false` values)
- Adjust the map settings: 
    - `center`: Center of the map as default (when GPS is off). Use latitude/longitude value pairs
    - `zoomable`: Set the default map able to zoom (use `true/false`)
    - `draggable`: Set the default map able to be dragged (use `true/false`)
    - `zoom`: Value between 0 and 18 (0 = mininmal zoom, 18 = maximum zoom)

#### Modify the displayed data
- Go to the file `src/data_components/layers.json` (containing sample data as an example)
- Edit the file with your layers
    - Each layer must be a `json` Object wrapped in `{}`
    - Each layer can be one of eigther `marker` or `route` 
    - The name of the layer is also the name used for displaying it on the map
    - Each layer can contain multiple items in an array `[{item}, {item2}]`
    - Each item must have a unique `name`
    - Provide the coordinates of your layers in pairs of latitude/longitude
    - Routes are used as single layer, so to add multiple `route` objects, add multiple layers
    - Add a pop-up to a marker by adding the element `popup` to an item of a marker. This will be displayed. It can be be styled with html elements (example: `<b>Hello world!</b><br>I am a popup.`)

#### Adding pictures for streetview
Add the picture to the folder `www/img`.

## Extending the app

To add further plugins or extensions, create a new file in `src/business_components` with your logic and `export` your functions. Then in the component, that shall be extended (map, streetview), `require` the new file and just use your new functions like `module.method()`. To have the new modules as a part of the app, you need to run the build again `npm run build`.

## Add more Logs
The Logger delivered with the app provides two exported functions: `logEntry(data)` and `stopLoggingAndWriteFile`. The logs have the structure: `Date/Time, Latitude, Longitude, Mode, Action`. To add more logs create an array and call `logger.logEntry(myData)` with it. The logfile can be found on the devices' root directory and is called `lbs-engine-logger.csv`.  

## Further development
The streetview component is a dummy mode at the moment. An interaction to change the displayed image and respond to location events needs to be implemented.

## Bugs
Due to an [error](https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/2307) in OnsenUI's last version, the tabs are a little hacked right now. Can be fixed with an update of OnsenUI.
